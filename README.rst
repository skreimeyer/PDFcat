PDFcat
======

Pdfcat will take all pdfs within a folder and combine them into a single new
file. This may be useful for users who do not have Adobe Acrobat Pro, but do
have access to a python interpreter.

Basic Usage:

    pdfcat PDF_FOLDER OUTPUT_FILENAME.pdf

Pdfcat is intentionally a very simple tool, which might meet a very particular
need, ie merging pdf documents into a single document.
